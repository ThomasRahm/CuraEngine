**Describe the bug**
Describe the bug, if it is more than an error message.

**Revision number displayed in the error message**
E.g. 1 
I use this number to track versions.

**To Reproduce**  
Steps to reproduce the behavior if more was done than just press slice. There also is the possibility to save a project (File -> Save Project) but these files can become quite large.  **Only share this file if there are no copyright issues with sharing the model**

**Amount of CPU threads or the name of your CPU**  
While unlikely it could be that the error only occurs if the code runs on a certain amount of threads. You can find this information in the task manager under performance => Logical processors

**IMPORTANT Model and Profile**
If I can't reproduce the issue it will be impossible for me to find the cause of it. This is the easiest way for me to be able to reproduce an issue. If the files are smaller than 25mb you can just zip them and append them by dragging them into this text-field. If the model is available somewhere for download e.g. on thingiverse i prefer the link to this for the model.  **Do not upload model files that may have issues with copyright.**
